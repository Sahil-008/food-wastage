        <h2 style= font-size:50px;>About</h2><p><br> The aim of the research study is to make an overall analysis of food wastes, its various types and their causes, composting and different processes involved, various methods and techniques practiced in different countries, and overall benefits and advantages/disadvantages of food waste composting. There are mainly two broad categories of food waste viz., organic food waste arising due to human consumption at home, restaurants and inorganic waste which occurs at upstream and downstream levels involved in food manufacturing process etc. Food waste are categorized in to various types namely production, processing, distribution, acquisition, preparation, and consumption<br>
<br>
The evil consequences of food waste are due to large amount of energy losses occur when food is dispensed, comprising the energy needed for production and distribution of food, processing wasted food, as well as the energy seized inside the food itself. However certain types of food waste are unavoidable and hence composting process is adopted to marginalise evil aspects of the former. Composting is a process carried out under controlled biological maturity at aerobic conditions, where organic matter of animal or vegetal origin is decomposed to materials with shorter molecular chains, more stable, hygienic, humus rich, and finally beneficial for the agricultural crops and for recycling of soil organic matter. Compost helps to return organic materials to the soil and keeps them out of landfills and waterway and overall can also be used as a mulch, a liquid “fertilizer,” or integrated into the soil. The agents of composting are divided in to primary, secondary, and tertiary level of consuments.<br>
<br>

Ideally there are 2 phases of composting in which organic matter undergo change known as Degradation and Maturation. Various methods of composting for home, agricultural or industrial etc with specific mention to latest methods like NADEP are clearly highlighted for better understanding with the multiple parameters involved in composting process also being given adequate attention. The research study categorized the best composting practices adopted in various countries and gives cue in selecting most economically viable ones in current use with their benefits.

            Food wastage is a significant problem that affects millions of people around the world. Every year, tons of edible food are thrown away, while many go hungry. It's time to raise awareness and take action.

<h2 style= font-size:45px;>FOOD WASTAGE IN VARIOUS CONTRIES</h2>


<p style=font-size:25px;>Food waste produced annually in selected countries worldwide 2020</p><br>
Published by Ian Tiseo, Feb 6, 2023<br>


 <p><br>China and India produce more household food waste than any other country worldwide at an estimated 92 million and 69 million metric tons every year, respectively. This is unsurprising, considering both countries have by far the largest populations globally. Food waste has often been thought to be concentrated in wealthier countries, however, in terms of food waste per capita, there are similarities between developed and developing countries. It is estimated that per capita food waste production is highest in Western Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>
</p>


<p style= font-size:25px;>Sources of food waste<br><br></p><p>
The global population produced approximately 931 million metric tons of food waste in 2019. This represented roughly 17 percent of total food made available. Household food waste was the main source of food waste that year, accounting for 61 percent of the total. The second main source of food waste was the foodservice sector.
</p><br>


<p style= font-size:25px;>Why is food waste such a problem?</p><br><p>
Food waste has many societal impacts that affect all of us. It not only costs the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars every year and depletes resources, but it also harms the environment and contributes to the climate crisis. When food waste is dumped at landfill sites it rots and produces large volumes of methane – a potent greenhouse gas. Food waste accounts for an estimated nine percent of global food system greenhouse gas emissions, which in 2015 totaled 17.9 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent.<br>

        <h2>Solutions</h2><br>
        <p>
            <h1>Proposed Solutions to Food Waste</h1><br>

<strong>Globally</strong>, reducing wasted food has been cited as a key initiative in achieving a sustainable food future. Sustainable Development Goal 12 addresses responsible consumption and production, which includes two indicators to measure (in order to ultimately reduce) global food loss and food waste. <br><br>

In the U.S, on June 4, 2013, the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, calling on entities across the food chain, including farms, agricultural processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, universities, schools, and local governments. <br> The goals are to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Reduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.</l1><br><br>
<li>Recover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger relief organizations like food banks and pantries.<br><br>
</li><li>Recycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy, and natural fertilizers.
</li></ul><br><br><br>
On September 16, 2015, both agencies also announced for the first time a national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 to improve overall food security and conserve natural resources.<br><br>

The National Resources Defense Council issued a summary paper providing guidelines on how to reduce waste throughout the food production chain. [2] The following are some focal points:
<ol>

<li><strong>State and local governments</strong> can incorporate food waste prevention and education campaigns, and implement municipal composting programs. Governments can provide tax credits to farmers who donate excess produce to local food banks. Proposed bills are currently in place in California, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado.</li><br>

<li><strong>Businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services</strong> can evaluate the extent of their food waste and adopt best practices. Examples include supermarkets selling damaged or nearly expired produce at discounted prices, or offering “half-off” promotions instead of “buy-one-get-one-free” promotions. Restaurants can offer smaller portions and donate excess ingredients and prepared uneaten food to charities. Schools may experiment with concepts that allow children to create their own meals to prevent less discarded food, such as with salad bars or build-your-own burritos.</li><br>
<li><strong>Farms</strong> can evaluate food losses during processing, distribution, and storage and adopt best practices. Farmers markets can sell “ugly” produce, which are discarded, misshapen fruits and vegetables that do not meet the usual standards for appearance. Farms can sell fresh but unmarketable produce (due to appearance) to food banks at a reduced rate.</li><br>
<li><strong>Consumers</strong> can learn when food is no longer safe and edible, how to cook and store food properly, and how to compost. <br><br>



"Food Recovery Hierarchy" graphic by the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyThe Environmental Protection Agency provides the “Food Recovery Hierarchy” graphic to explain ways to handle excess food. [8] From the most preferred at the top of the pyramid to the least preferred at the bottom tip, the methods include:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Source reduction: Earliest prevention by reducing the overall volume of food produced</li><br>
<li>Feed hungry people: Donating excess food to community sites</li>
<br><li>Feed animals: Donating food scraps and waste to local farmers who can use them for animal feed</li>
<br><li>Industrial uses: Donating used fats, oils, and grease to make biodiesel fuel</li>
<br><li>Composting: Food waste that is composted to produce organic matter that is used to fertilize soil</li>
<br><li>Landfill/Incineration: A last resort for unused food</li>
